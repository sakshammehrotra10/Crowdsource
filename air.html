        <div class="air-pollution-is">
          Air pollution is the contamination of air due to the presence of
          substances in the atmosphere that are harmful to the health of humans
          and other living beings, or cause damage to the climate or to
          materials. It is also the contamination of indoor or outdoor
          surrounding either by chemical activities, physical or biological
          agents that alters the natural features of the atmosphere. There are
          many different types of air pollutants, such as gases (including
          ammonia, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxides, methane and
          chlorofluorocarbons), particulates (both organic and inorganic), and
          biological molecules. Air pollution can cause diseases, allergies, and
          even death to humans; it can also cause harm to other living organisms
          such as animals and crops, and may damage the natural environment (for
          example, climate change, ozone depletion or habitat degradation) or
          built environment (for example, acid rain). Air pollution can be
          caused by both human activities and natural phenomena.

              The combustion of fossil fuels emits a large amount of sulphur
              dioxide. Carbon monoxide released by incomplete combustion of
              fossil fuels also results in air pollution.

              Factories and industries are the main source of carbon monoxide,
              organic compounds, hydrocarbons and chemicals. These are released

              Due to the emission of greenhouse gases, there is an imbalance in
              the gaseous composition of the air. This has led to an increase in
              the temperature of the earth. This increase in earth’s temperature
              is known as global warming.

              The burning of fossil fuels releases harmful gases such as
