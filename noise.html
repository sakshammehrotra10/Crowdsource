              Noise pollution is an invisible danger. It cannot be seen, but it
              is present nonetheless, both on land and under the sea. Noise
              pollution is considered to be any unwanted or disturbing sound
              that affects the health and well-being of humans and other
              organisms.

            <p class="noise-pollution-is">
              Sound is measured in decibels. There are many sounds in the
              environment, from rustling leaves (20 to 30 decibels) to a
              thunderclap (120 decibels) to the wail of a siren (120 to 140
              decibels). Sounds that reach 85 decibels or higher can harm a
              person’s ears. Sound sources that exceed this threshold include
              familiar things, such as power lawn mowers (90 decibels), subway
              trains (90 to 115 decibels), and loud rock concerts (110 to 120
              decibels).

              Noise pollution impacts millions of people on a daily basis. The
              most common health problem it causes is Noise Induced Hearing Loss
              (NIHL). Exposure to loud noise can also cause high blood pressure,
              heart disease, sleep disturbances, and stress. These health
              problems can affect all age groups, especially children. Many
              children who live near noisy airports or streets have been found
              to suffer from stress and other problems, such as impairments in
              memory, attention level, and reading skill.

            <p class="noise-pollution-is">
              Industrialisation: Industrialisation has led to an increase in
              noise pollution as the use of heavy machinery such as generators,
              mills, huge exhaust fans are used, resulting in the production of
              unwanted noise.
            </p>
            <p class="noise-pollution-is">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="noise-pollution-is">
              Vehicles: Increased number of vehicles on the roads are the second
              reason for noise pollution.
            </p>
            <p class="noise-pollution-is">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="noise-pollution-is">
              Events: Weddings, public gatherings involve loudspeakers to play
              music resulting in the production of unwanted noise in the
              neighbourhood.

            <p class="noise-pollution-is">
              Construction sites: Mining, construction of buildings, etc add to
              the noise pollution.

            <p class="noise-pollution-is">
              Hearing Damage: Prolonged exposure to high levels of noise can
              cause permanent damage to the hearing, leading to hearing loss or
              impairment.
            </p>
            <p class="noise-pollution-is">
              Stress and Anxiety: Noise pollution is a significant stressor that
              can contribute to elevated levels of stress and anxiety. Chronic
              exposure to noise has been linked to cardiovascular problems,
              increased blood pressure, and a higher risk of heart disease.

              Continuous exposure to noise can impair concentration, memory, and
              learning abilities. It can also hinder task performance and reduce
              productivity.

            <p class="noise-pollution-is">
              Noise pollution can make it challenging to communicate
              effectively. This is particularly problematic in urban areas where
              high levels of ambient noise can interfere with speech and
              auditory signals.
