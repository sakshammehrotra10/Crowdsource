        <b class="what-is-soil">What is Soil Pollution?</b>
        <div class="soil-contamination-soil">
          Soil contamination, soil pollution, or land pollution as a part of
          land degradation is caused by the presence of xenobiotic (human-made)
          chemicals or other alteration in the natural soil environment. It is
          typically caused by industrial activity, agricultural chemicals or
          improper disposal of waste. The most common chemicals involved are
          petroleum hydrocarbons, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (such as
          naphthalene and benzo(a)pyrene), solvents, pesticides, lead, and other
          heavy metals. Contamination is correlated with the degree of
          industrialization and intensity of chemical substance. The concern
          over soil contamination stems primarily from health risks, from direct
          contact with the contaminated soil, vapour from the contaminants, or
          from secondary contamination of water supplies within and underlying
          the soil. Mapping of contaminated soil sites and the resulting clean
          ups are time-consuming and expensive tasks, and require expertise in
          geology, hydrology, chemistry, computer modelling, and GIS in
          Environmental Contamination, as well as an appreciation of the history
          of industrial chemistry.

              The contamination of soil has a major consequence on human health.
              Crops and plants that are grown on polluted soil absorb most of
              the pollution and then pass them to humans. Living, working, or
              playing in contaminated soil can lead to respiratory diseases,
              skin diseases, and other health problems. Diseases caused by soil
              pollution include Irritation of the skin and the eyes, Headaches,
              nausea, vomiting, Coughing, pain in the chest, and wheezin

              In such a short period of time, plants are unable to adapt to the
              soil change chemistry. Fungi and bacteria found in the soil that
              bind them together start to decline, which creates an additional
              problem in soil erosion. Regular use of chemical fertilizers,
              inorganic fertilizers, pesticides will decrease the fertility of
              the soil and alter the structure of soil. This will lead to a
              decrease in soil quality and poor quality of crops. The fertility
              of the soil diminishes slowly, making land unsuitable for
              agriculture and any local vegetation to survive.
