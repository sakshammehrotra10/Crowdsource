        <div class="water-pollution-or">
          Water pollution (or aquatic pollution) is the contamination of water
          bodies, usually as a result of human activities, so that it negatively
          affects its uses. 6  Water bodies include lakes, rivers, oceans,
          aquifers, reservoirs and groundwater. Water pollution results when
          contaminants mix with these water bodies. Contaminants can come from
          one of four main sources: sewage discharges, industrial activities,
          agricultural activities, and urban runoff including stormwater. Water
          pollution is either surface water pollution or groundwater pollution.
          This form of pollution can lead to many problems, such as the
          degradation of aquatic ecosystems or spreading water-borne diseases
          when people use polluted water for drinking or irrigation. Another
          problem is that water pollution reduces the ecosystem services (such
          as providing drinking water) that the water resource would otherwise
          provide. A practical definition of water pollution is: "Water
          pollution is the addition of substances or energy forms that directly
          or indirectly alter the nature of the water body in such a manner that
          negatively affects its legitimate uses". 6  Water is typically
          referred to as polluted when it is impaired by anthropogenic
          contaminants. Due to these contaminants, it either no longer supports
          a certain human use, such as drinking water, or undergoes a marked
          shift in its ability to support its biotic communities, such as fish.
